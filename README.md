# Simple Linear Regression

Demonstration of the scikit-learn linear regression tools.

## Outline
In this project I will investigate how age affects insurance costs by:
- Ploting a scatter plot with age on the x-axis and charges on the y-axis.
- Using `linear_model.LinearRegression()` from `sklearn`, fit a model to
the data, and make predictions on the data.
- Plotting another scatter plot with the best-fit line.
